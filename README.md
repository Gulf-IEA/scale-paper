# scale-paper
This Github is a place to share code - a "sandbox" if you will - for the analysis of the wetland cover vs. commercial fishing at various scales analysis.
Note that most data will live elsewhere (like personal computers) due to privacy concerns, so code should reference the file structure but will need to be amended for the actual path location.

Etiquette of using our code bank: please create your own personal sandbox named something like "regressions-Amy" so that people know not to alter your code while you're still actively working on it. 
When you're done, copy it into the master Quarto document with any annotations and explanations you need.

We have our running document that will eventually become our paper here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IsHblLDZvmhwOSEXitfgjb6vv_IwjASK3Dizi6fHgUw/edit
