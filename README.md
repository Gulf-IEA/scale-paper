# scale-paper
This Github is a place to share code - a "sandbox" if you will - for the analysis of the wetland cover vs. commercial fishing at various scales analysis.
Note that most data will live elsewhere (like personal computers) due to privacy concerns, so code should reference the file structure but will need to be amended for hte actual path location.

We have our running document that will eventually become our paper here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IsHblLDZvmhwOSEXitfgjb6vv_IwjASK3Dizi6fHgUw/edit
